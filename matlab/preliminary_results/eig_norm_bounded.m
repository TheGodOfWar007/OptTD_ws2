% This file was created to test the hypothesis (which is intuitively clear
% tbh) that for a norm bounded adjacency matrix, i.e. bounded weights for
% example due to limited energy and link weights being proportional to
% energy, the sum of eigenvalues is bounded and that the number of non-zero
% eigenvalues increases with the number of links thus making the system
% more vulnerable to a perturbation blow up when under attack.
